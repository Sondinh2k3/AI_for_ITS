## For committing PPO training implementation

```
feat: Add PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) training implementation

- Create train_ppo.py: Main PPO training script with multi-worker support
  - Multi-network support (grid4x4, 4x4loop, zurich, PhuQuoc)
  - Parallel workers for efficient data collection
  - GPU support for faster training
  - Automatic checkpoint saving and management
  - Custom stopper for max iterations or reward threshold
  - Full hyperparameter customization
  - Real-time monitoring and metrics

- Create eval_ppo.py: Model evaluation script
  - Load trained PPO checkpoints
  - Multi-episode evaluation
  - Per-episode statistics tracking
  - Optional GUI rendering support

- Create ppo_config_examples.py: 5 pre-defined PPO configurations
  1. Small network (fast testing)
  2. Medium network (production - default)
  3. Large network (high performance)
  4. Exploration-focused (hard problems)
  5. Stability-focused (convergence)
  - Hyperparameter tuning guide

- Create verify_setup.py: Setup verification utility
  - Check Python version and packages
  - Verify SUMO configuration
  - Validate project structure
  - Check network files
  - Auto-create results directory
  - Clear troubleshooting suggestions

- Add comprehensive documentation:
  - TRAINING_GUIDE.md: 400+ line detailed guide
  - PPO_SUMMARY.md: Quick start guide
  - PPO_IMPLEMENTATION.md: Full implementation report
  - scripts/README_PPO.md: Workflow and monitoring guide
  - INDEX.md: File index and documentation roadmap
  
- Create scripts/run_training.sh: Interactive bash menu
  - Easy training/evaluation without command line

ALGORITHM:
- Implements Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with:
  - Clipped objective loss for stable learning
  - Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE)
  - Separate value and policy networks
  - Multi-agent support via Ray RLlib

FEATURES:
- Multi-network traffic simulation environments
- Parallel data collection with configurable workers
- GPU acceleration support
- Checkpoint management with keep-best strategy
- Automatic experiment logging with timestamps
- Extensive hyperparameter customization
- Real-time training monitoring
- Evaluation on trained models

BREAKING CHANGES: None
- No changes to src/environment/drl_algo/ (environment code)
- No changes to pyproject.toml (dependencies)
- Backward compatible with existing scripts

Test Coverage:
- verify_setup.py can be run for environment validation
- train_ppo.py works with all supported networks
- eval_ppo.py successfully loads and evaluates checkpoints

Documentation:
- 60+ KB of documentation files
- 5 example configurations
- Setup verification utility
- Comprehensive troubleshooting guide
```

## Usage After Commit

```bash
# Verify setup
python verify_setup.py

# Quick test (development)
python scripts/train_ppo.py --iterations 10 --workers 1

# Standard training (production)
python scripts/train_ppo.py --network grid4x4 --iterations 100 --workers 2

# Advanced (with GPU)
python scripts/train_ppo.py --network zurich --iterations 500 --workers 4 --gpu

# Evaluate
python scripts/eval_ppo.py --checkpoint <checkpoint_path> --episodes 5
```
